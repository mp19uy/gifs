## Curating your own gif library

You can also [fork the original repo](https://github.com/jglovier/gifs/fork) to your own account, and have your own gif library. Once you fork to your own account, you can even host your own GH Pages site ([like mine](http://mp19uy.github.io/gifs/)) 

To update the site index on the GH Pages site, you'll need to run the index build script. Just clone the project to your local machine, open Terminal, and `cd` into the repo. Then, run `script/build_site_index` and commit your changes. Once the new index is commited to your gh-pages branch, it will be live on your site as soon as the CDN updates (usually within a few minutes).
